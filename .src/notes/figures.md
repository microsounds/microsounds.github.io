# My Collection of Assorted Figurines (oops all miku!)
Last updated {UPDATED}

Here's my ~~small, yet~~ growing IRL collection of figurines and other assorted cute things that I'm slowly running out of room for.
Most of my collection consists of inexpensive _"prize figures"_ of the type you could win from a Japanese ["skill" claw machine][claw], these are more modest and less ambitious in detail, size, and/or paintwork quality than much higher priced _"scale figures,"_ though these days, it's not uncommon to find prizes that rival more expensive figures in one or more of these categories.

I live an ocean away from the eastern archipelago where they speak the anime girl language and physical arcades with _UFO catchers_ still dot the landscape, so I end up buying endless variations of [my electric angel][micker] anywhere I spot them in the wild. Recently, the [historically weak yen][jpy] has me importing[^import] far more often than I used to.

I don't feel like making an account on _[myfigurecollection.net][mfc]_ to keep track of my collection, so this page piggybacks off their API, links will take you to their catalog entry on _mfc_[^api].

[^api]:
	Note: mfc likes to [change their API endpoints][1] a lot, if images are broken, it's not for [a lack of trying][2].

[^import]:
	For people in the U.S., you can put a decimal point to the left of the 2nd least significant digit in **JPY** prices and you should have an approximation of the cost in **USD** after international shipping,
	_for example ¥2,800 becomes $28.00_.

	This assumes you are shipping multiple items in one order, preferably more than 3 in the case of low value items such as prize figures.
	Most timely shipping options from Japan start at ¥4,000, single item shipments are rarely cost effective unless they exceed ¥16,000.

## Collection
_Sorted by when I remember getting it, from newest to oldest._
<br />_Abstract entries like figures that have yet to ship or release are in dotted yellow, Mikus I'll find someday are at the very end._

## If you plan to buy or preorder unreleased figures from Japan
If collecting figures well ahead of their release is something that interests you, be warned that the domestic industry surrounding it is a _predatory one_ that uses gambling mechanics, preorders, small production runs, and long lead times of 6 months or more to dull the impact of irresponsible purchases and maximize your FOMO in order to get you to impulse purchase figures you might have otherwise ignored if they weren't in danger of selling out during the preorder stage and being immediately scalped in the secondary market!

If a figure is desirable enough, preorders can sell out before the figure has even been finalized, it might just be that the figure is an overpriced, unpopular dud and immediately goes for half the preorder price as a used figure, or it could be that the finished figure looks far better than it did in production shots and you lucked out!

It's not uncommon to see gacha-tier mechanics like exclusive accessories or face plates for ordering from specific shops.
I'm fully expecting outright abusive figure gacha mechanics in the near future, which such tactics like:
* _preorders being done away with in favor of lottery systems, like kujis but worse!_
* _store exclusive rare accessories or variants like face plates for every 1 in 50 paying customers!_
* _figures limited to 3,000 sales FOREVER with no-rerelease guarantees!_

***Do not fall for their tricks!***


## If you're a casual, low-information buyer of figures
As a more uninformed figure collector, take care not to fall for counterfeit figures of varying quality sold at abnormally low prices, usually imitating designs that are years out of production, yet being sold new in box.

In years past, only elaborate and expensive lines of figures would see bootlegging but now even inexpensive prize figures quickly get imitations mere months after release.
I remember when _"replica"_ nendoroids were a fringe hobby good relegated to the depths of untrustworthy Chinese e-commerce sites, they only cost 20% what a real one would cost, including the shipping.

Do not assume that physical outlets located in shopping malls, indoor or outdoor swap meets are honest or have any clue what they are selling, they can and will play dumb if it suits them. Some are egregious enough to sell fakes at genuine prices to low-information buyers.

Be wary of online listings on e-commerce sites using only official promo shots or photoshopping faces.

Some tell-tale signs include:
* box artwork that [omits manufacturer logos and brand names](https://myfigurecollection.net/picture/2402764)
* faces that just look "off", screenprinted eyes that have a [bizarre skew](https://myfigurecollection.net/picture/2182516)
* individual parts that won't fit together correctly or won't stay snug
* designs standing on one leg that cannot hold their own weight and bend at a steep angle
* designs that [don't actually exist](https://myfigurecollection.net/picture/3267308), combinations of 2 or more characters at the same time[^rem]
* paint fading quickly even in interior lights from store displays
* visible molding seams _(flash)_, ABS plastics yellowing, PVC vinyls leaking plasticizer and turning sticky
* [sloppy paint, gloppy paint](https://myfigurecollection.net/picture/2529349) and paint overspray, a complete disregard for quality

Quality can vary wildly with knockoffs, they consistently teeter the line between **garbage** and **barely acceptable** _(from one viewing angle)_, with few exceptions.
The best possible case is coming across "quality rejects" from the genuine production run, but in general, they have no residual resale or collectible value if you care about that sort of thing.
That being said, I won't advise against buying them willingly and deliberately if you accept the drawbacks.

[^rem]: A wild new frontier in bootlegs, this is a combination of
	[this Rem](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/1047417) and [this Miku](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/944728).
