# My Collection of Assorted Figurines
Last updated {UPDATED}

Here's my ~~small, yet~~ growing IRL collection of figurines and other assorted cute things.
Most are _"prize figures"_ of the variety you could win from a Japanese ["skill" claw machine][claw].
Unfortunately, I live an ocean away from a _UFO catcher_ full of figurines of everyone's favorite [virtual idol][micker], so I can only buy them.

Since I don't feel like actually making an account on _[myfigurecollection.net][mfc]_ to tell people about them, this page that piggybacks off their API will do for now. Links will take you to their catalog entry on _mfc_.

## On Counterfeits
If you're into figure collecting, take care not to fall for counterfeit figures of varying quality sold at abnormally low prices, usually imitating designs that are years out of production, yet being sold new in box.

In years past, only elaborate and expensive lines of figures would see bootlegging but now even inexpensive prize figures quickly get imitations mere months after release.
I remember when _"replica"_ nendoroids were a fringe hobby good relegated to the depths of untrustworthy Chinese e-commerce sites, they only cost 20% what a real one would cost, including the shipping.

Do not assume that physical outlets located in shopping malls, indoor or outdoor swap meets are honest or have any clue what they are selling, they can and will play dumb if it suits them. Some are egregious enough to sell fakes at genuine prices to low-information buyers.

Be wary of online listings on e-commerce sites using only official promo shots or photoshopping faces.

Some tell-tale signs include:
* box artwork that [omits manufacturer logos and brand names](https://myfigurecollection.net/picture/2402764)
* faces that just look "off", screenprinted eyes that have a [bizarre skew](https://myfigurecollection.net/picture/2182516)
* individual parts that won't fit together correctly or won't stay snug
* designs standing on one leg that cannot hold their own weight and bend at a steep angle
* designs that [don't actually exist](https://myfigurecollection.net/picture/3267308), combinations of 2 or more characters at the same time[^rem]
* paint fading quickly even in interior lights from store displays
* visible molding seams _(flash)_, ABS plastics yellowing, PVC vinyls leaking plasticizer and turning sticky
* [sloppy paint, gloppy paint](https://myfigurecollection.net/picture/2529349) and paint overspray, a complete disregard for quality

Quality can vary wildly with knockoffs, they consistently teeter the line between **garbage** and **barely acceptable** _(from one viewing angle)_, with few exceptions.
The best possible case is coming across "quality rejects" from the genuine production run, but in general, they have no resale or collectible value if you care about that sort of thing.
That being said, I won't advise against buying them willingly and deliberately if you accept the drawbacks.

[^rem]: A wild new frontier in bootlegs, this is a combination of
