This is a [`kagami`][kagami] template and accompanying source code that renders my personal site at <https://microsounds.github.io/>

## ![w3c](static/button/valid-html5-blue.svg) Validation

This site aims for **polyglot HTML5** compliance, a robust well-formed subset of HTML5 and XHTML as defined by [W3C][polyglot] and [WHATWG][polyglot2] for more rigorous syntax validation.
This is sometimes referred to as XHTML5.

Documents should render identically when served as `text/html` or `application/xhtml+xml`.
In practice, serving as XHTML results in worse initial stylesheet draw in every browser I've tried this in.
You can test this yourself using [Schneegan's XHTML Proxy][proxy].

Use of modern features such as `audio` elements prevents validating as true [XHTML 1.0 Strict][xml].

## Deploying
Normally, I run `kagami` and commit build artifacts in `master`.
It's just easier and works everywhere, even on my phone.

* Use something simple like `busybox httpd` to preview changes before pushing, it's what I use.
* You could also comment out `unset DOC_ROOT` in `.kagami/macros` if you want to build for local viewing only.
	* AJAX calls to `file://` URIs will silently fail due to CORS restrictions in modern web browsers.

> **NOTE**<br/>
> This part is not kept up to date.

Scripts in `.kagami/macros` and `.scripts/` have hard dependencies on my userland environment located [here][atelier],
and operate under the assumption that you are me and you have a copy of all my dotfiles sitting in your `$HOME`
* Some examples include:
	* `.kagami/macros` expects my `~/.local/lib/moonphase-date` â€” timestamp conversion routines, requires GNU `date`, `bc`
	* `.scripts/dotfiles-ls.sh` expects every single file in my userland environment to properly build `notes/dotfiles.md`
	* `.scripts/unreachable.sh` expects git alias `list-files` to spider through this repo to check for broken links.

### External build processes pushing to this repo
Updates to my [userland environment][atelier] trigger an Actions workflow that
performs a simplified version fo the CI/CD behavior described below as a side
effect of testing my dotfiles on every revision.

## On CI/CD automated page builds
If your plan is to use GitHub Pages with your own static site generator, you
could keep only source code in `master` and automatically `push -f` build
artifacts to a different orphan branch not unlike what GitHub does for pages
using Jekyll.

If you want to avoid cluttering your commit history with CI commits coming from your account,
use the `github-action` bot's `git` username `github-actions` and email address `github-actions@github.com` when committing.

### Committing to a different repo
The default per-run GitHub Actions token `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` will not allow you to push new commits to a a different repo you control.

For GitHub Pages, this requires creating a Personal Access Token with at least `public_repo` permissions and adding it to your repo's secrets.
* _Generate a PAT at `Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens`_

* _An example workflow depicting this automated build behavior can be found [here](static/unused/build.yml)_.
