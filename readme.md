This is a kagami template that renders my personal site <https://microsounds.github.io/>
* Scripts in `.kagami/macros` and `.scripts/` expect one or more components from dotfiles located here: <https://microsounds.github.io/notes/dotfiles.htm>
	* `.local/lib/moonphase-date` — timestamp conversion routines, requires GNU coreutils `date`
	* `readme.md` — required to build the page linked above
