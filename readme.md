This is a [`kagami`][kagami] template that renders my personal site at <https://microsounds.github.io/>

* Scripts in `.kagami/macros` and `.scripts/` have hard dependencies on my personal shell scripts located [here][atelier].
	* `.local/lib/moonphase-date` — timestamp conversion routines, requires GNU coreutils `date`
	* `readme.md` — required to build `notes/dotfiles.md`
