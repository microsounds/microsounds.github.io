<title>My Collection of Assorted Figurines</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ Last updated Here’s my small, yet growing IRL collection of figurines and other assorted cute things. Most are “prize figures” of the variety you could win from a Japanese [“skill” claw machine][claw]. Unfortunately, I live an ocean away from a UFO catcher full of figurines of everyone’s favorite [virtual idol][micker], so I can only buy them. Since I don’t feel like actually making an account on [myfigurecollection.net][mfc] to tell people about them, this page that piggybacks off their API [..]]]>

<title>List of low profile GPUs for small form factor PCs (SFFs)</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ Last updated . Most GPU marketing materials will use the term LP or “low profile” to refer to graphics cards that are half the height of a normal GPU, not full-height short-length GPUs meant for Mini-ITX cases. As far as discrete graphics go, these are the most space and energy-efficient GPUs that money can buy, ideal for use in space-saving PCs, small form factor PCs (SFFs), home theater PCs (HTPCs), slimline cases, specialty server hardware, and other niche form-factors [..]]]>

<title>On Copyleft and why I use GPLv3</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ This is a short outline on guaranteeing creative freedom to users of your works through copyleft. Licensing of creative works is an extremely tiresome topic so I keep all my opinions on intellectual property law contained to this page. You can use the term “software” in place of “creative works” and it should have the same gist. I release my creative works under a strong [copyleft license][copyleft] with an attribution and sharealike requirement for several reasons— I want future [..]]]>
