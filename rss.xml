<title>My Collection of Assorted Figurines (oops all miku!)</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ Last updated Here’s my small, yet growing IRL collection of figurines and other assorted cute things that I’m slowly running out of room for. Most of my collection consists of inexpensive “prize figures” of the type you could win from a Japanese [“skill” claw machine][claw], these are more modest and less ambitious in detail, character pose, and/or paintwork quality than much higher priced “scale figures,” though these days, it’s not uncommon to find prizes that rival more far more [..]]]>

<title>List of low profile GPUs for small form factor PCs (SFFs)</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ Last updated . Most GPU marketing materials will use the term LP or “low profile” to refer to graphics cards that are half the height of a normal GPU, not full-height short-length GPUs meant for Mini-ITX cases. As far as discrete graphics go, these are the most space and energy-efficient GPUs that money can buy, ideal for use in space-saving PCs, small form factor PCs (SFFs), home theater PCs (HTPCs), slimline cases, specialty server hardware, and other niche form-factors [..]]]>

<title>Thoughts on the disrespectful Suruga-ya.com (not suruga-ya.jp)</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ TL;DR Do NOT buy from suruya-ga.com, order from suruga-ya.jp with a forwarding service of your choice. Established in 19481, Suruga-ya (駿河屋) is a Japanese used goods retailer specializing in physical media, electronics and collectibles in a similar vein to Book-Off, Mandarake and AmiAmi (pre-owned), they operate physical shops all throughout Japan and also offer domestic mail order through suruga-ya.jp, and most recently suruga-ya.com for international customers outside of Japan. Previously, you needed to employ the use of a proxy [..]]]>

<title>Termux: SSH fingerprint authentication using Android Keystore</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ Written on . If you’re unfamiliar with Termux, it’s an extensible Android terminal emulator that papers over the user-hostile quirks of the Android operating system to provide a mostly faithful Linux environment for running familiar *nix software. It comes with an extensive APT package repository cross-compiled for ARM devices. You can install it from F-Droid or from upstream. Does this turn your unrooted Android smartphone into a handheld Linux terminal? Yes. Does this ascend your smartphone from a toy [..]]]>

<title>On Copyleft and why I use GPLv3</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ This is a short outline on guaranteeing creative freedom to users of your works through copyleft. Licensing of creative works is an extremely tiresome topic so I keep all my opinions on intellectual property law contained to this page. You can use the term “software” in place of “creative works” and it should have the same gist. I release my creative works under a strong [copyleft license][copyleft] with an attribution and sharealike requirement for several reasons— I want future [..]]]>
