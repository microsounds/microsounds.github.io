<title>My Collection of Assorted Figurines</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ Last updated Here’s my small IRL collection of figurines and other assorted cute things. Most are “prize figures” of the variety you could win from a Japanese “skill” claw machine, but I do no such thing because I don’t live anywhere near one stocked with prize figures I would actually like. I don’t feel like actually making an account on myfigurecollection.net to tell people about them though. This page will do for now, links take you to their catalog [..]]]>

<title>List of low profile GPUs for small form factor PCs (SFFs)</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ Last updated . NOTICE I cannot recommend going the SFF route at this time, or even the discrete GPU route in general, every worthwhile card on this list has skyrocketed in price on the used market. Most GPU marketing materials will use the term LP or “low profile” to refer to graphics cards that are half the height of a normal GPU, not full-height short-length GPUs meant for Mini-ITX cases. These are ideal for use in space-saving PCs, small [..]]]>

<title>On Copyleft and why I use GPLv3</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ This is a short outline on guaranteeing creative freedom to users of your works through copyleft. Licensing of creative works is an extremely tiresome topic and I don’t want to put more thought into it than whatever is contained on this page. You can use the term “software” in place of “creative works” and it should have the same gist. I release my creative works under a strong [copyleft license][copyleft] with an attribution and sharealike requirement for several reasons— [..]]]>
