<h1>Termux: SSH fingerprint authentication using Android Keystore<span id="Termux:-SSH-fingerprint-authentication-using-Android-Keystore"></span></h1>
<p>Written on 🌗 Thu, Dec 21st, 2023.</p>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar with <em>Termux</em>, it’s an extensible <a href="https://termux.dev">Android terminal emulator</a> that papers over the user-hostile quirks of the Android operating system to provide a mostly faithful Linux environment for running familiar *nix software. It comes with an extensive <a href="https://packages.termux.dev/">APT package repository</a> cross-compiled for ARM devices.
You can install it from <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux">F-Droid</a> or from <a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-app">upstream</a>.</p>
<p>Does this turn your unrooted Android smartphone into a handheld Linux terminal? Yes. <br/>
Does this ascend your smartphone from a toy computer into your most useful computing device when used to the fullest? Probably. Some people’s comfort comes from a portable VT220 emulator, you know.</p>
<h2>I seriously hope you’re not doing this.<span id="I-seriously-hope-youre-not-doing-this."></span></h2>
<p>I don’t like assuming the skill level of the reader, so I never write tutorials, but the loudest Termux users seem to be beginners to the *NIX command line in general.
This is why you see many Termux users misusing <code>termux-fingerprint</code> as <a href="https://archive.ph/huXAr">a simple app lock</a> for their Termux installation.</p>
<p>Their use of biometric security starts and ends at checking for a simple return value in their <code>~/.bashrc</code>, something that can be bypassed by opening a failsafe session.</p>
<h2>Your phone is literally a YubiKey<span id="Your-phone-is-literally-a-YubiKey"></span></h2>
<p>It was around this time last year where I thought it would be really cool if <code>ssh-agent</code> could use my fingerprint reader instead of a passphrase to add my OpenSSH keys, but I gave up when I saw the return value of <code>termux-fingerprint</code> provided by <code>termux-api</code>, you only get an authentication success or failure message, no key material is returned which could be used to generate a plaintext passphrase. I initially wrote this off as just another example of *nix software being a second class citizen on Android and giving up.</p>

</video>
<div class="aside">(Yes, I'm recording the screen because Android doesn't allow screenshots of the fingerprint lock screen.)</div>
<p>But did you know that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment">trusted execution environment</a> <em>(a.k.a security chip, embedded controller, EC, secure element, etc.)</em> on your device is exposed to Android via the <a href="https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/keystore">Android Keystore API</a>, providing functionality similar to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YubiKey">YubiKey</a> where it can generate non-extractable encryption keys made available to you only during a customizable validity period after a successful phone unlock attempt?
<code>termux-api</code> already exposes this functionality to Termux with <code>termux-keystore</code>, there isn’t any writing about <a href="https://archive.ph/I6e0K">connecting the two together</a> for some reason.</p>
<p>OpenSSH already allows for calling arbitrary graphical utilities to collect the passphrase from the user, you can write a drop-in replacement to generate an RSA signed passphrase using fingerprint lock protected encryption keys.</p>
<p>It’s really easy and everything just works, you can be as lazy as you want without affecting your opsec <em>too</em> much.</p>
<h2>Writing a drop-in replacement for <code>ssh-askpass</code><span id="Writing-a-drop-in-replacement-for-ssh-askpass"></span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong> <br/>
<em>This is an ongoing experiment in balancing convenience and security, your security threat model may find the barebones security provided by fingerprint sensors unacceptable.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>You should have the add-on app <code>Termux:API</code> and it’s companion library Termux package <code>termux-api</code> installed before continuing.</li>
<li>Create a hardware-backed inaccessible RSA 4096-bit private key named <code>default</code> in your hardware-backed keystore.
<ul>
<li><code>termux-keystore generate 'default' -a RSA -s 4096 -u 5</code></li>
<li><code>-u</code> sets the key validity period in seconds after a successful device unlock.</li>
<li><code>-u 0</code> disables this functionality, don’t do that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><code>ssh-agent</code> and friends call <code>$SSH_ASKPASS</code> from your path whenever trying to work with passphrase protected encryption keys.
Set this to the name of the new drop-in replacement you’ll be writing to by exporting the following envvars:</p>
<pre><code># ~/.profile, or ~/.bashrc if you're extra stupid
export SSH_ASKPASS='termux-ssh-askpass'
export SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE='force'
</code></pre>
<p>Then you drop a shell script in your path that calls <code>termux-fingerprint</code>, which only returns some JSON containing <code>AUTH_RESULT_SUCCESS</code> if it succeeded.
<code>termux-fingerprint</code> can also take some strings to customize user-facing prompt text but these aren’t required.</p>
<p>After a successful fingerprint unlock, you have 5 seconds to run <code>termux-keystore sign</code> and sign a nonce value. This can be anything, as long as it’s unchanging.
I personally sign the matching public key file<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn-1" id="fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="data-footnote-ref">1</a></sup> for the private key being unlocked, but for simplicity, you can just as easily use the string <code>'sdhfkdsklfjlksdjfkljdsklf'</code>.</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env sh

# termux-ssh-askpass v0.1
termux-fingerprint -d &quot;$1&quot; | jq -r '.auth_result' | fgrep -q 'AUTH_RESULT_SUCCESS' || exit 1
echo 'sdhfkdsklfjlksdjfkljdsklf' | termux-keystore sign 'default' SHA256withRSA | base64 -w 0
</code></pre>
<p>Then just convert the binary signed nonce data emitted by the security chip to plaintext in any way you like, <code>base64 -w 0</code> is fine.</p>
<p>Now prime the pump by changing the passphrase on your existing key(s) with the output from <code>termux-ssh-askpass</code>, though you may want to run it standalone first to make sure everything works.</p>
<pre><code>SSH_ASKPASS= ssh-keygen -p -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -N &quot;$(termux-ssh-askpass)&quot; -F 'old passphrase'
</code></pre>
<p>If you’ve done everything correctly, your new passphrase is now a very long string of plaintext</p>
<p>It’s basically as seamless as having no passphrase at all.
It requires biometrics to generate, the signing key used to generate it cannot be extracted from your phone’s hardware-backed keystore, and while I also get this is absolutely overkill for most people, it’s also really convenient!</p>
<p>I use <code>ssh-keygen -Y sign</code> and <code>openssl enc</code> as the <a href="/notes/dotfiles.htm#nano">basis for file encryption</a> so you can imagine how much of a quality of life improvement this brings over dealing with <code>ssh-agent</code> through Gboard.</p>
<h2>Important considerations<span id="Important-considerations"></span></h2>
<p>If your threat model hovers somewhere around <em><strong>not wanting someone to pretend to be you while having physical access to your device</strong></em>, I think this does pretty well.</p>
<p>This works with zero chance of vendor or device lock-in, as you are not using key material from the security chip for SSH authentication, it’s only used to decrypt your existing SSH key.</p>
<p>Even though someone with physical access to your unlocked Android device <em><strong>could</strong></em> modify the hardware keystore without authentication and <em><strong>could</strong></em> replace keys with identically named keys that have an unlimited validity period, they will not be the same key material used to produce your signed passphrase.</p>
<p>You also understand that, by replacing passphrases with biometrics, your <em><strong>fingerprint reader becomes your single point of failure</strong></em>, you really should not be using this kind of thing if your threat model includes <em>bioluminescent individuals</em>, you have been warned!</p>
<section class="footnotes" data-footnotes="data-footnotes">
<ol>
<li id="fn-1">
<p>I wanted to maintain feature parity with other <code>ssh-askpass</code> drop-in replacements, OpenSSH passes in a text prompt with the form <code>'Enter passphrase for /path/to/key: '</code> meant to be shown to the user.</p>
<p>Parsing this to get the path to the private key while also accounting for <code>l18n</code> is a real pain and this is supposed to be easy.</p>
<p>You can see <a href="https://github.com/microsounds/atelier/blob/master/.local/lib/termux-ssh-askpass">how I wrote mine</a> if you’re really interested, but emitting customized prompt text in your fingerprint lock screen and using the matching public key as a nonce value doesn’t doesn’t add any appreciable security whatsoever. <a href="#fnref-1" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref="data-footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref-idx="1" aria-label="Back to reference 1">↩</a></p>
